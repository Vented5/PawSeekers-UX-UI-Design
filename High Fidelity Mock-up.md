### High Fidelity Mock-up
Well.. for this mock-up the pages are mostly similar to the original design.. there are still some changes not contemplated from the low fidelity mock-up like the e-commerce.

The high fidelity mock-up is being designed using UX-pin. the preview is at: <br>

### User authentication
This module covers two pages of the design.. initializing session or creating an account. Its pretty much a ussual login. The interactions are restricted so you can only continue to the main page by filling the forrns.<br>

### Main page
The main page of the application consist on the map. Where the user is appearing on the center and it shows the near missing pets reports. (This page can be improved... im still testing the interactions).<br>

### Detailed report page
Here is all the information of the missing pet. All its features and information of its sightings sorted in a single page, also some information of the user it belongs.(I want to include a map with a tracking of the sightings).<br>

### Store
Since the rubric requires the app to have an online store... i added a section to buy tracker collars for the  pets. In order to reduce the risk of getting lost. It is said that the best tool is the one you only use once right?... so once the users find their pets they can buy an "insurance" ;3.
(Still working on the payment page). <br>
