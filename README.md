# PawSeekers-UX-UI-Design

<hr>

UX-UI Design Repository for the mobile application of the PawSeekers project.

The muck-up includes six pages.

1. **Login page:** Standard credentials authentication. Also consider using third party applications to facilitate the sign and logging in. <br>
2. **Register** page for new users.<br>
3. **Main page:**  Contemplates the main functionality of the application which is to help users finding their lost pets. Its main feature is the implementation of a real time map service. This page also includes the list of missing pets near the user location. Clicking on a report will redirect the user to the detailed report page.<br>
4. **Detailed report page:** It includes the information, characteristics, sighting history (tracking) and photos of the missing pet. Also includes the owner's contact information. And the possibility to report a sighting ff the missing pet (That will be included in the history) and also contact the owner if the pet has been secured.<br>
5. **Report a sighting.** This is one of the most important pages. since here is where the app stands out the rest. It gets advantage of the users near a missing report and allows them to upload images of a lost pet that matches the description of a report.<br>
6. **Chat.** This would be one of the most complex... (rather tedious) features to implement. Since this is not a critical feature and could easily be overridden by providing contact information... Its considered to protect the user's personal information and have more control over the hole process of recovering a missing pet and delivering it to their beloved owner.
